# Graph Mapper

An NPM package for a fast, two-way object graph mapper.

## Installation

```
npm install --save graph-mapper
```

## Why?

There are some other general object mappers out there. But I needed a mapper that was fast, declarative, AND could explain itself to me later. I want to provide one or more target paths, and get an explaination of what sources are needed to generate them.

## Docs?

You can find the full documentation by reading through the spec: `lib/graph-mapper.spec.js`
